      body: `Through my career I have been on a never ending quest to learn
             new things that excites me and feels fresh. As a Software engineer, 
             this great because new tools and frameworks are coming out very
             frequently. With me on the team you get someone who think it's a 
             privilege to learn about new things and will jump at the opportunity
             to do so.`,

      body: ` During the course of my carees I learnt the value of clear and concise
            exchange of information. Many meetings are just wasted on
            missunderstandings and useless talking about things not related to
            getting the work done. I absolutely hate wasting time, and as such,
            clear concise and structured communication is religion.`,

            several technology fields, I have a solid foundation of computer
            science. It is important to bring in as many perspectives to a project
            as possible. With me you will have someone who can think from the
            Silicon structures, through the machine code, Asembly code and up to
            the top level fluffy stuff like JavaScript.`,

      title: "Getting things done",
      body: `I dislike spending time on discussions that does not bring any real
            value. I've seen the impact on a project which dives too deep into the
            details and (as we all know), it's not pretty. I'm big on tools that
            actually makes working more effective, and try to exclude everything
            else. Let's face it, our brains are lazy. It needs dicipline to trick
            our brains to keep delivering, and I like to keep the momentum up!`,

  I currently live in Hangzhou, China, a really exciting city, and my wifes hometown. My career goal is that I want to build things that are new, refreshing, and makes a difference for others. I really enjoy solving tough problems.

  MSc. in Electrical Engineering: Design of Processors and Integrated Systems. We dived deep into computer science, large scale software development, JAVA, signal processing and Chip design / fabrication. We also did some FPGA development with VHDL / Verilog, designed MEMS and did a wide range of embedded projects. Tons and tons of math, analysis, analogue electronics, we ran through a lot in those 5 years.
  
  Right out of university I was soon becoming a father, and I got an offer to take up the role as an electronics engineer at a stable local company. Needless to say, it was a great start, the work was rewarding and I was learning brand new things everyday. 3.5 years down the line I decided to make a change, I realized that I wanted to change direction into Software Engineering. This is because I never stopped coding on my free time.
  
  In early 2019 and after about 9 months of self study into the React eco-system, and web development, I landed my current job as a Software Development Engineer, and Remote has been a great experience for me.

    exchange of information. Many meetings are just wasted on
    missunderstandings and useless talking about things not related to
    getting the work done. I absolutely hate wasting time, and as such,
    clear concise and structured communication is religion.`,

    several technology fields, I have a solid foundation of computer
    science. It is important to bring in as many perspectives to a project
    as possible. With me you will have someone who can think from the
    Silicon structures, through the machine code, Asembly code and up to
    the top level fluffy stuff like JavaScript.`,

    value. I've seen the impact on a project which dives too deep into the
    details and (as we all know), it's not pretty. I'm big on tools that
    actually makes working more effective, and try to exclude everything
    else. Let's face it, our brains are lazy. It needs dicipline to trick
    our brains to keep delivering, and I like to keep the momentum up!`,
